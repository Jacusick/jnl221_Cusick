			<h2> The Oscar Diversity Landscape </h2>
			<h4> Even with a strong, rising trend in representation, the Academy Awards continue to be a space dominated by its white winners. <br>Jack Cusick </h4>

			<h3>A History</h3>

			<p>It was nearly a decade ago the Oscars were forced to reckon with their apparent diversity issues. In 2015, the academy received major backlash when they announced all 20 of their acting nominees for that year were white. In response to that, #OscarsSoWhite, started by writer and activist April Reign, became the center of discussion. The following year, the 20 nominees, for the second year in a row, were all white, resurfacing the hashtag and giving it even more prominence. This time, the prominence of the hashtag got the attention of the academy and spurred new policies that helped boost diversity and BIPOC representation.

<br> Now, eight years after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/movies/oscarssowhite-history.html" target="blank">the pivotal hashtag</a>
, the need to promote and increase diversity in all aspects of media is more important and recognized than ever. The following 3 years showcased improvement with significant wins for films like Moonlight and Get Out, but the period after the 2020 ceremony might have been an even more powerful era of change. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd’s murder, the push for representation for not just black voices but all types of BIPOC groups helped move the needle even further. The past few years after this movement have featured milestone wins for many performers of non-white races and ethnicities. But outside of these milestones, the major categories have just started pushing the line in terms of representation. The data collected here will reflect the current position of BIPOC representation trends, as well as show how level the spread of races across categories is. <br> </p>

			<h3>The Present</h3>

			<p>When comparing the same period of nine years before #OscarsSoWhite to after its prominence and impact, the effects of the academy’s new policies are distinctly present across the examined categories.
<br>From 2016 to the present day, the BIPOC groups displayed very solid percentage growth across the board. Black winners, already the most prominent BIPOC group from 2007 to 2015, made up 50% more of the distribution than they already had. Asian winners made the largest jump, however, moving from just over 2% of the total to over 13% of the wins. The prosperity of Asian representation likely stemmed from the success of the film Everything Everywhere All At Once at the 2023 ceremony, which snagged not just Best Picture, but three wins for Michelle Yeoh (Best Actress), Ke Huy Quan (Best Supporting Actor), and Daniel Kim (Best Director). Additionally, Bong Joon-Ho’s Best Director win for Parasite was one of the most prominent wins not just for Asian directors, but for all BIPOC directors as well. <br>
<br> However, the past few years of growth have not broken away from the white-dominated presence just yet. As the chart shows, there is a clear drop of 20% between the datasets, taking away from the 80% hold of the previous decade. However, white winners still make up more than all other races and ethnicities combined, with a strong 60%. While the data undeniably shows trends favorable to an equitable balance, a lot more work may still need to be done.<br>
<br>"I would actually say that there has not been an increase in representation, whether it's in the movies released or even in nominations.” This is the stance of Tula Goenka, activist and film professor at Syracuse University, on how the Oscars and the general attitude of the film industry are representing diversity today. Goenka, who has worked with directors such as Spike Lee, feels that even with the academy’s recognition of more diverse individuals, there still aren’t enough films with BIPOC involvement to keep up with those lacking it. Goenka assesses the industry as something that cannot escape its inadequacy, saying  “…that [BIPOC] population of creatives, studio executive actors, etc, has grown a little bit, but I don't think it is at a critical mass at all.”<br>

			<h3>Where is the BIPOC rep needed?</h3>
			<p>Though the academy is beginning to work towards equality in BIPOC wins, it's important to analyze how they approach creating equity across these awards. Through organizing data of the awards BIPOC groups have primarily won and lost, patterns can be found in what categories groups are more or less likely to be recognized. According to the chart, almost 60% of all BIPOC wins come from the awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. This data serves as a reflection on Hollywood's tendencies to primarily have BIPOC people in supporting roles, and largely only acknowledge these supporting roles with the awards. A further example of this can be seen through how not even 5% of BIPOC wins are for Best Actress. This not only points to the heavy imbalance of how BIPOC are being represented through these categories but shows how women of color aren’t being given many opportunities in leading roles that give attention to them. </p>

			<h3>The Future</h3>
			<p>The Academy’s necessary changes are not something that can or are happening overnight. Past that, it’s also clear that these awards are not determined as much by the state of society, but by a membership to a group "The winners are decided by the membership... It's an American award for Hollywood cinema... It's not very representative" Goenka said. In the pursuit of equity for people of color in Hollywood, people must be willing to support films that support BIPOC and are persistent enough to see the change through. As Goenka said, "It takes time... Change takes time."</p>
